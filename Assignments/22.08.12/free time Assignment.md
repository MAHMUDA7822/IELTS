As is illustrated by the chart that a person how much free time got per week in five working places throughout the period from 1998 to 1999.

As can be clearly shown by the graph that male persons got more additional time to enjoy than the opposite gender. Overtly men lead in three out of five sections: employed full time, unemployed, and retired. However, women are ahead only in two figures.

The graph shows information about that an unemployed and a retired male person found more time for enjoyment than a woman, with on an average 85 hours per week compared to around 75 hours for the woman. Unfortunately, a fall has been observed in full-time employment for both genders. The leisure time decreased markedly to 45 hours for men and 35 hours for women.

By contrast, housewives and the part-time employed woman got huge time for their relaxation whereas men hit at the lowest point. In those categories, no data is shown for men according to the timeline given in the upper chart.
